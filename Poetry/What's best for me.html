    <h1>What's best for me</h1>
    It's hard, living how I am. <br>
    It sucks. <br>
    I feel trapped. <br>
    Trapped within my own skin. <br>
    This body isn't mine. <br>
    I could fix it, I could make it better. <br>
    But that's not my decision to make. <br>
    That's yours, isn't it? <br>
    And no matter how much I try to convince you... <br>
    You keep telling you that you know what's best for me. <br>
    But I don't think you do. <br>
    <em>I</em> know what's best for me. <br>
    Being me is what's best for me. <br>
    But you won't let that happen, will you?
