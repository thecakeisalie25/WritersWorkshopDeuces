        The author focuses on the more positive aspects of relationships, while not at all hitting on the negitave
        aspects. This paints an unrealistic version of relationships. While it does lightly touch on them, the positive
        aspects are heavily favored. With emotions like glee, giddieness, etc. It's hard not to smile at their
        relationship.</li>

        <i>Reading Comprehension</i> is very effective. The book metaphor really lends itself greatly to how her
        picture is stuck in a chapter of the author's life, marking a chapter she could never finish, or basically
        saying how she could never get past this event, something about this girl she could never get over. Being as
        short as it is makes the reader want more, but they never get it.

        This piece shows greatly how a disease can impact people. It shows the struggles of not only the person
        suffering but the people around them. The title shows how suddenly it happens, how disease can strike without
        warning. <i>...but he was healthy</i> is something often said when a disease strikes suddenly.

        It's about someone with a traumatic past. Something she can't get over. When the author talks about the untimely death of her childhood it makes me think about something that happened to her.

        It serves to frame the story as an everyday interraction, showing how the person going through this has this sort of thing happen daily. They can never take their mind off of it.

    <li>I loved <i>Reading Comprehension</i>, because it really packs a punch with what little it has.</li>
    <li>I disliked <i>Philadelphia</i>, because it's too long and never really goes anywhere, it's too empty.</li>
