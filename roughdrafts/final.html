    <h1>Adventurer's log.</h1>
    <h2>D1:H1</h2>
        <p>No final to report. The rest of the passengers worked on their simulations of a human financial career, while I, already having finished, sat among them and acted as one. Will continue to report. I bid Commander Hedrick goodbye, I won't be reporting him after break.</p>
    <h2>D1:H2</h2>
        <p>The final in biology wasn't the least bit difficult, most of it was multiple choice anyways, the easiest of tests. Will continue to report. </p>
    <h2>D1:H2.5</h2>
        <p>No students had finals this hour. It wasn't difficult, considering that I had nothing I actually had to do. Will continue to report. I report back to Commander Hunt tomorrow for the real final exam.</p>
    <h2>D1:H5</h2>
        <p>The final of AP Computer Science. These devices are very easy to manipulate and bend to my will, thus it was a very easy final. So far there have been no anomalies to report. </p>
    <h2>D1:H6</h2>
        <p>There was no final to report. Commander Kelly is the reason I write this log. This marks the end of D1. Will report back tomorrow. 
    <h2>D2:H3</h2>
        <p>My fear of a low grade was completely nullified when I found that the exam was multiple choice. I think I did okay. Not perfect, but okay. Will continue to report.</p>
    <h2>D2:H4</h2>
        <p>I see Commander Hunt again, this time for the actual exam. It was multiple choice, and thus it was not too difficult. This seems to be a pattern. One left to go.</p>
    <h2>D2:H7</h2>
        <p>The final frontier. My grasp of low-level electronics is passable at best, but I tried my best and I think I did okay. </p>
