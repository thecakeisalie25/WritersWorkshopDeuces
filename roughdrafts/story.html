    <p>The Crystal Heart is one of the most powerful forces left in the world after what happened all those years ago: the war, the terrible terrible war. It ravaged the lands, killing millions and millions of Magi and humans alike, making both worlds desolate and barren. All but a few of the Magi were wiped out, and all six types of zir were wiped out completely. We managed to keep the humans from killing all of us before we were able to meet with humanity's "President" to sign a treaty and end the war, but we suffered heavy losses. The deaths of the war were nothing, however, compared to the starvation we suffered after. Without any zir (short for stabilizer) we had no way to keep our magic stable. If we had even a single type of zir we could grow the others through some combination, we made sure of that as a failsafe about 60,000 years ago, but we never thought of what could happen without any of them. The elders are far, far gone now, and without anyone whose magic is as powerful as them, there's no way to create something so powerful. Even if we could, our magic is so unstable it's impossible to keep control for long enough. There was only one person who would be able to save us: Ab. She'd managed to kill one of the humans without destroying their soul. She'd absorbed it, she'd made herself one with it. Her and the human were one, not Magi, not human, but something more. Something more than the sum of their parts. A hybrid. A fusion. </p>
    <p>She woke up, and got out of her bed. At least, she tried to. Her magic had been unstable since the war, and thus today it felt like teleporting her into the ceiling. After cutting herself out, she got down, went out onto the front porch, and made breakfast. Luckily, her fire magic was still in check, it was the one she'd trained in for all her life after all. It helps that the human soul she had seemed to like fire a little more than the healthy amount. Eh, at least it helps. Most people weren't lucky enough to even have one. </p>
    <p>"Hey, Ab!" shouts Ember, one of Ab's friends, a year younger.</p>
    <p>"Oh, hey! Everything alright?" Ab replies, "Aren't you usually still asleep this early?"</p>
    <p>"Yeah, it's all good. My magic kept me up. Keeps summoning scary stuff, demons, warewolves, santa, stuff like that. Couldn't sleep." she shouts back, climbing the ladder up to Ab's house. Everyone had to install rope ladders, since teleporting was no longer a viable option for most. </p>
    <p>"Santa?" questioned Ab.</p>
    <p>"Don't ask." said Ember, her chippy and cheery tone of voice suddenly descending a few octaves. </p>
    <p>"Ho Ho Ho" mocked Ab, poking Ember in the cheek and making her jump a slight bit. </p>
    <p>"Uh, anyways..." Ember said, changing the subject, "How's the Crystal Heart, everything still smooth with that?"</p>
    <p>The Crystal Heart was the village's life source, the single source of magic flowing through each and every one of us. Ever since the elders made the original zir crops, we'd been using zir to make it distribute magic to us when we needed it, instead of just giving it out randomly against our will. </p>
    <p>"As far as I know, yeah. Seems to be getting more unstable, though. Not sure how long we can keep this going."</p>
    <p>"Then something needs to be done!" Ember said, with the utmost determination, a gleam in her eyes Ab had become all too familiar with.</p>
    <p>Ab chuckled. "Oh yeah? What do you suggest?"</p>
    <p>Ember pouted. "Ab, I'm serious! I've got a plan this time!" </p>
    <p>Ab decided to humor her. "Alright, alright, sorry. What's your plan?"</p>
    <p>Ember beamed with determination, shouting "Humans! They destroy any zir they touch, so they must be able to make it, right?"</p>
    <p>This was Ember's stupidest idea yet.</p>
    <p>"Okay, but how do you suggest we make that happen? Humans have never made any before, considering they don't have any in their world. At least, none that I saw. And there's no w--"</p>
    <p>Ember gasps excitedly. "You went to the human world?!"</p>
    <p>"Of course, silly! Where do you think I got this?" Ab lets her human soul out for a moment, letting it float around her head. </p>
    <p>"Whoaaaaah!" Ember looks excitedly at it, examining it carefully.</p>
    <p>"Have I never shown it to you before?" Ab takes the soul back into her body, getting a chill down her spine as she does. "I got it back in the war."</p>
    <p>"What's the human world like?" Ember asks.</p>
    <p>"Well, I didn't get to see that much of it. Most of the fighting was done on our side. It wasn't really --"</p>
    <p>"Eep!" Ember's hand shoots up from the balcony it was resting on, fire magic eminating from the singed handprint she left. "Ugghhhh! We gotta fix this. My fire magic keeps acting up. Isn't there SOMETHING we can do? </p>
    <hr>
    <p>The village counsil welcomed us, and pulled out a couple of chairs.</p>
    <p>"So, what have you come before us to discuss?" the head counsilman asked.</p>
    <p>"The Crystal Heart." Ab replied. "There must be some way to repair it. Make it grow some form of zir again. This isn't sustainable."</p>
    <p>"Yes, we're aware. We've been trying to recreate the Elders' methods for some time now. Nothing we've tried has worked. Do you have anything to bring to the table?" The counsilman folded his arms in frustration.</p>
    <p>"A human soul." The room went quiet. Dead quiet. </p>
    <hr>
    <p>After a few minutes of debate, they decided that none of them have the knowledge to deal with it. That's where the Decendents come in. The Decendents are the direct lineage of the Elders. All 6 are well versed in magic, and each one of them can still control two skils at least. Each Decendent is a master of one particular skill.</p>
    <p>"I'm Fry." the first one says as we sit down at a hexagonal table around some sort of hexagonal machine. "I'm the master of Fonn magic." Fry produces a small flame at his fingertips, and plays with it for a second, moving it between each of his fingers before finally passing it into the machine and lighting a small candle in one of it's six faces. </p>
    <p>"I'm Teo, master of Tel magic." the next one says, teleporting a marble somewhere inside the second face of the machine, completely inaccesible to those without magic.</p>
    <p>"I'm Quill, master of Aquii magic." says the next one in line, making a ball, once floating in about 10cm of water, sink like a rock, pushing an underwater button.</p>
    <p>"I'm Flora, master of Eeoh magic." she says, a rhythmic tone to her voice as a small vine reaches around a lever inside the machine and pulls it down. </p>
    <p>"I'm Grey, master of Cel magic." the fifth one says, switching gravity for the machine so that a rock that was on the bottom now falls to the top and hits a button.</p>
    <p>"I'm Spa--" Ember cuts the last one off. </p>
    <p>"Wait wait wait, couldn't we just turn the machine upside-down for that last one?" Ember says, a puzzled look on her face.</p>
    <p>"I mean... Uh... Well... One thing that... Uh..." Grey stammers. "You <em>COULD</em> do that. Yes. That is a thing you could do."</p>
    <p>"Anyways," the sixth one butts in, "I'm Sparx. Take a wild guess at what type of magic I do." He says, placing a hand on either side of the machine, sparks flying between his fingers. "You guessed it, Vi magic." </p>
    <p>The machine comes to life, splitting in twain and projecting some sort of globe-like hologram into the air. It seemed familiar, but it wasn't the normal one Ab was used to. </p>
    <p>"You've all heard of Earth, right?" says Sparx, moving the map so that we can see what appears to be called "New Yonk" or something, the map isn't very clear. "That's where you'll be going. We've been theorizing that if something with trace amounts of lots of humans on it came into direct contact with the crystal heart, we could use the power of a human soul catalyze one type of zir, whichever type the bearer of the soul is strongest with. From there, we could use that type to make the rest, as per the instructions of the Elders. </p>
    <p>"And you're sure this will work?" Ab replied. "What if the humans find us? Neither species is allowed to go between worlds as per the treaty."</p>
    <p>"We've been scouting out the worlds beyond the barrier for a while now, indirectly. There's something called 'cosplay' where humans dress up in ornate and realistic costumes. We figure you could use this as a sort of cover story, and pretend you're just cosplaying and not really a Magi."</p>
    <p>"Wait, so I'm gonna pretend to be a human pretending to be a Magi? Seems a bit roundabout, but okay, easy enough." said Ab. </p>
    <p>"Yeah, hopefully." Sparx said. </p>
    <p>"Alright, so just go to the human world and find something with the essence of a lot of humans, right? What would I even look for?" queries Ab.</p>
    <p>"They have something called 'currency'. Apparently, they exchange currency for things like food, work, water, etc. They don't just share with whoever needs it. Either way, some of the smaller denominations of currency are made out of some sort of metal. If you get a bunch of these, it should work pretty well."</p>
    <p>"Alright, so what are we waiting for?"</p>
    <hr> <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
    <p>Stepping through the barrier, Ab squinted her eyes at the staggering amount of lights. Even at night, the sprawling city in front of her was awash with light, making her squint her eyes. As she stepped out into the city, she noticed that there was something on the ground. An orangeish-brown circle, about the diameter of a cherry, but really flat. She picked it up, examining it. She heard a voice in her ears. </p>
    <p>"There, that's one. Get a few more of those and we'll be golden!" It was Sparx, communicating telepathically. "Then we can restart the Crystal Heart and grow some Fonn zir!"</p>
    <p>"Alright, but where am I going to get some more of these? It's not like I'll just find some lying around." </p>
    <p>"Just ask people, I'm sure you'll find some. They're called 'pennies'."</p>
    <p>"Alright. Sounds like a plan." She flagged down a human walking slower than everyone else, visibly aged and graying in the hair. "Excuse me, do you know where I could find some pennies?" she asked the woman, not the least bit nervous.</p>
    <p>"Oh, what a neat little costume you've got there! I'm sure I've got some, in here, let me check." she said in the sweetest little voice possible. "I've got like 20, will that work?"</p>
    <p>"That'll do wonders. Thank you so much." Ab said, accepting the pennies from the woman.</p>
    <p>Ab returned back to the allyway from whence she came, returning to her world, and making a mad dash, pennies in hand, back to the Crystal Heart.</p>
    <p>"Alright, I'm here. What do I do now?" She asked Sparx, hoping he could hear. </p>
    <p>"Put the pennies on the heart. If they'll work, they should stick." said the disembodied voice. She did as he said, and they stuck. </p>
    <p>"Alright, what's next?"</p>
    <p>"Now, let the human soul free, and guide it towards the heart."</p>
    <p>The heart shimmered in a way it hadn't since the war. "What now?"</p>
    <p>"Use your Fonn magic, try to burn the heart. Trust me." </p>
    <p>"Burn the heart? Are you crazy?!" </p>
    <p>"Trust me! It's the only way this will work!"</p>
    <p>"Okay..." she replied, nervous. She did it, though. Very carefully, but she did. </p>
    <p>It worked.</p>
    <p>It actually worked.</p>
    <p>A single piece of Fonn zir sprouted out of the Heart.</p>
    <p>Then another. </p>
    <p>Then another still.</p>
    <p>It kept going. </p>
    <p>She'd done it.</p>
    <p>She'd really done it.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>She returned to the Descendents. "Nice! Thank you Ab. We'll take care of making the other six types, you just relax. You've earned it."</p>
    <p>So she went off to Ember's house. Seeing the huge grin on Ember's face, she asked "Hey Ember, what's poppin'? You look happy."</p>
    <p>"Oh, you know what they say..." Ember said, barely able to stifle a laugh.</p>
    <p>"No, what do they say?"</p>
    <p>Ember burst out laughing. "No, tell me!" said Ab.</p>
    <p>"You know what they say: Ab's Cents make the Heart grow Fonn zir!"</p>
