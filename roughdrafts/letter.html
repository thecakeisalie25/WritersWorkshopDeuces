    <h1>To my future self, whoever you are.</h1>
    <p>Dear future me:</p>
    <!-- I hope this letter finds you well, likely rewrite --LA -->
    <p>Hi, it's me. Well, you. Well, us, but from the past. Or the present. whatever.</p>
    <p>It's been a while, hasn't it? I wonder who you are. Did you finally get past all that stuff you were going through? Did you finally figure out who you are? Who we are? I'm still troubled by all that. I don't know what I want for us. What I want us to be. Should I stay a guy? Would it be better to be a gal? Would life be a little easier if I gave up a bit of who I was? Should I keep pursuing this, let it go? I suppose even you don't know. You're one possibility in a world of endless choices. </p>
    <p>I suppose I have to choose this for myself. That makes sense. I don't want to stay like this. I can't stay like this. I've gotta do <em>something</em>. So that's one possibility down, two to go. I feel like no matter what I do, the other version of me would be better. I guess you don't really exist yet, what I do now will change you in ways I can't even think of now. I feel like I'm making a choice between being true to myself or to the closest thing that's within the norms. </p>
    <p>The problem is, I identify with both. There's only one of me, and there's infinity of you. Every second, millions of you die out just because I made one choice and not the other. By the time I become you, there'll be only one of us left. The true one, the only one that aligns with all the choices I made for us. Whether I pick the trans or nonbinary side is up to me, but what happens from there is almost out of my hands. <!--  Do I get on hormones? Does it make this body better? --> Have I given up at life? Will this letter even arrive to anyone? Can anything fix us? Only time and a million dead clones will tell. </p>
    <p>I hope this letter finds us well. I'll do my best to steer the cosmic ship of the multiverse to somewhere good, you just enjoy the ride. And when I inevitibly pass the helm off to you, I hope you'll be sailing in clearer waters than I was. </p>
    <p>Signing off, <strike>Larson</strike> Tabbs.</p>
