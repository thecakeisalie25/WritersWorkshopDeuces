    <h1>Agree / Disagree</h1>
    <h2>Should every child be forced to serve in the millitary?</h2>
    <p>In combat, I would say no. A definite no. But during times of peace, or for non-war roles, I'd say it's not that bad of an idea. I've no strong feelings one way or another, but if each child were to go into the millitary for something they're interested in, like computer science or repair, it might help them get actual work experience without all the pressure of having a first-time job. It could allow them to skip all the boring first-time jobs that we require here in america, like working at mcdonalds or burger king, and allow them to jump straight into work with the right skills to do so in a real environment.</p>
