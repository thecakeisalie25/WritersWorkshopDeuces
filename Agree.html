    <h1>Agree / Disagree</h1>
    <h2>Should every child be forced to serve in the millitary?</h2>
    <p>In combat, I would say no. A definite no. But during times of peace, or for non-war roles, I'd say it's not that bad of an idea. I've no strong feelings one way or another, but if each child were to go into the millitary for something they're interested in, like computer science or repair, it might help them get actual work experience without all the pressure of having a first-time job. It could allow them to skip all the boring first-time jobs that we require here in america, like working at mcdonalds or burger king, and allow them to jump straight into work with the right skills to do so in a real environment.</p>
    <h2>Can we blame technology for the shortcomings of the people that use it?</h2>
    <p>At first, this would seem like a simple NO. Hard and fast. That's it, no. But there may be something more to it than that. If a piece of technology has complete, anonymous free speech, that's gonna be conducive to some hateful opinions. That's their right though, it's the people saying those things that are at fault. But if a piece of technology blocks anyone who doesn't think the KKK should run the government, then that piece of technology just created an environment of hatred. Keep in mind that everything there was said by a human, but the technology blocked everything that wasn't pro-kkk. Would tech be blamed for this? </p>
    <h2>Should guns be restricted?</h2>
    <p>Yes. The sale of guns should be completely banned. Not the usage or ownage of guns, the sale. If people are smart enough to make their own CNC machine and carve out a lower reciever, they're smart enough to own a gun. LR 80%s should be restricted by requiring ID to buy, but other than that untracked. This would still allow people to own guns, but wouldn't allow any old joe to go down to the market and buy one without being smart enough to properly handle one. Restricting the owning of weapons by who's smart enough to make them seems like the only alternative to letting idiots own guns. The problem isn't guns. It's idiots with guns. This fixes that issue.</p>
