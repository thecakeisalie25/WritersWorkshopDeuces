    <h1>God isn't real, grow up.</h1>
    <p>Okay, so let's start off with a few warnings. If you're sensitive about people talking about your faith, leave. This will be a hard-facts discussion, no namby-pamby feelings matter here. I'll be using the <abbr title="New International version">NIV</abbr> interchangibly with the <abbr title="King James Version">KJV</abbr>, but versions shouldn't be a problem for the "infalliable word of god", so that doesn't matter. If I reference a bible verse, you can hover over it to tell you what that verse says. With that out of the way, let's get started.</p>
    <p>First we need to talk about the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is a state of non-belief. In science, as well as anything but history and religion, it's assumed correct. It's difficult-to-impossible to disprove the existance of anything. If I told you that there's a small black teapot orbiting the sun, slightly between the orbits of earth and mars, you wouldn't believe me. This is true for most, if not all claims. For the claim to be accepted, there has to be evidence. Not direct observation, but evidence. If I say that my pen will fall if I drop it, that's a claim. My evidence for this is me dropping the pen and it falling. If I say that my pen will shoot into the sun if I click it, that's an equally valid claim as the first. But the fact that I can't provide any evidence for it makes it invalid. </p>
    <p>You're likely already seeing how this applies to the claims made by religion. "But what about the bible, the infallible word of god? Isn't that evidence enough?" you might say. Evidence? No. Infalliable? Well, there's a LOT of problems with the bible. Oh boy, there's a lot of problems with the bible. Strap in. </p>
    <h2>Bible-reality contradictions</h2>
    <p>The bible contradicts reality in MANY places. I'm gonna skip over genesis, because just about every single page has something completely absurd on it (No, the world was not created in seven literal days). Ever gotten sick because of something you ate? Not according to <abbr title="What goes into someone’s mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them.">Matthew 15:11.</abbr> Can people cheer so loud it causes an earthquake? Sure, says <abbr title="And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.">1 Kings 1:40</abbr> <abbr title="His breasts are full of milk.">Job 21:24</abbr> is pretty self explanatory.</p>
    <p>These stupid absurdities go on and on, but the biggest one has to be the firmament. What's the firmament, you ask? Well, let's just say that the flat-earthers didn't go far enough. <abbr title="Then God said, “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.” Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day.">Genesis 1:6-8</abbr> teaches us that there was water below the earth (which was flat), and water above it. and god created a barrier (which is later shown to be breakable by a single soldier on a mountain) between them. Heaven is also a physical place, and it's just above the firmament. The amount of mental gymnastics it takes to even come close to taking that as a rational thought is amazing. There's only really two ways to make this fit with reality, and neither of them are particularly good for Christianity. The first being that your god is wrong about the earth he supposedly created, bringing god's intelligence down to the level of the average toddler, or the fact that the bible is limited to humanity's knowledge at the time, which means it isn't the devine word of god but it's just a book. I prefer the latter, because most other things in the bible compound this.</p>
    <p>So the bible was wrong about a few things here and there, so what? It still insipired our great christian values!</p>
    <h2>Bible-Christianity contradictions</h2>
    <p>The bible was written in a different time, and thus a lot of the values contained within it are... outdated. However, most christians still cite it as the basis of our moral code. </p>
    <p>No.</p>
    <p>
        Lots of the things the bible prohibits are part of daily life. 
        <abbr title="A woman must not wear men’s clothing, nor a man wear women’s clothing, for the Lord your God detests anyone who does this.">Deuteronomy 22:5</abbr> is of intrest to any woman wearing pants.
        <abbr title="Do not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together.">Deuteronomy 22:12</abbr> states that anyone wearing two fabrics (some translations only restrict linen and wool, so much for the unchanging word of god) is going against the teachings of the lord.
        <abbr title="No one born of a forbidden marriage nor any of their descendants may enter the assembly of the Lord, not even in the tenth generation.">Deuteronomy 23:2</abbr> plainly says that you're not allowed in a church if you or anyone 10 generations up from you (this includes almost 2048 people, by the way) is the child of a "forbidden marrige".
        <abbr title="But if out in the country a man happens to meet a young woman pledged to be married and rapes her, only the man who has done this shall die. ">Deuteronomy 22:25</abbr> states that if someone in the country rapes someone who was pledged to be married, he shall be put to death. Pretty brutal, but it has the right intentions. If she isn't pledged to be married, however, he only has to pay off her father, and then they are forced to be married forever, and can't divorce as per <abbr title="If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered, he shall pay her father fifty shekels of silver. He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives.">Deuteronomy 25:28-29</abbr>
        Ever been rebellious to your parents? <abbr title="If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him, his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town. They shall say to the elders, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.” Then all the men of his town are to stone him to death. You must purge the evil from among you. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid">Deuteronomy 21:18-21</abbr> says you should have been stoned to death. 
        <br>
        And that's just in Deuteronomy. I could go on and on, but one of the most moral issues people justify with the bible is abortion. People cite the bible in their pro-life advertising. But unfortunately, that's just not viable. Not only did Jesus think abortions were okay, he even gave specific instructions on how to perform one. <abbr title="The priest shall bring her and have her stand before the Lord. Then he shall take some holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from the tabernacle floor into the water. After the priest has had the woman stand before the Lord, he shall loosen her hair and place in her hands the reminder-offering, the grain offering for jealousy, while he himself holds the bitter water that brings a curse. Then the priest shall put the woman under oath and say to her, If no other man has had sexual relations with you and you have not gone astray and become impure while married to your husband, may this bitter water that brings a curse not harm you. But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and you have made yourself impure by having sexual relations with a man other than your husband— here the priest is to put the woman under this curse—may the Lord cause you to become a curse among your people when he makes your womb miscarry and your abdomen swell. May this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen swells or your womb miscarries.">Numbers 16-22</abbr>. <q>May this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen swells or your womb miscarries.</q> So much for "life begins at conception".

    <h2>Bible-bible contradictions</h2>
    <p>When the scripture fights reality, some people say the scripture wins.</p>
    <p>When the scripture fights christians, some people say that our laws/morals are wrong.</p>
    <p>But when the scripture fights the scripture, who wins?</p>
    <p>There are a total of 536 currently known contradictions with the scripture. </p>
    <p>Here I'll list just a few of them. (For the shorter verses here, I'll just put the scripture next to the verses.)</p>
        <h3>Do christians sin?</h3>
            <h4>Of course.</h4>
                <p>There is no man that sinneth not. 1 Kings 8:46</p>
                <p>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23</p>
            <h4>Just kidding.</h4>
                <p>Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not. 1 John 3:6</p>
                <p>We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not. 1 John 5:18</p>
        <h3>Does god know everything?</h3>
            <h4>Of course.</h4>
                <p>God ... knoweth all things. 1 John 3:20</p>
                <p>The eyes of the Lord are in every place. Proverbs 15:3</p>
                <p>No thought can be withholden from thee. Job 42:2</p>
            <h4>Just kidding.</h4>
                <p>And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord, amongst the trees of the garden. And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? Genesis 3:8-9</p>
        <h3>Can people see god?</h3>
            <h4>Of course not.</h4>
                <p>No man hath seen God at any time. John 1:18, 1 John 4:12</p>
                <p>There shall no man see me, and live. Exodus 33:20</p>
            <h4>Just kidding.</h4>
                <p>And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him. Genesis 12:7</p>
                <p>And I [God] appeared unto Abraham. Exodus 6:3</p>
        <h3>Can god do everything?</h3>
            <h4>Of course he can. </h4>
                <p>For with God nothing shall be impossible. Luke 1:37</p>
            <h4>Except for some things.</h4>
                <p>And the Lord was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron. Judges 1:19</p>
    <p>Thus, the bible contradicts reality, christian morals, and even itself. Whoops.</p>
    <p>"But Tabbs!" I hear you say, "What about all my..."</p>
    <h2>Common Christian Arguments</h2>
        <h3><q>Okay, so the bible is false, that still doesn't disprove God.</q></h3>
            <p>Okay, fine. I'll give you that. We can't disprove Christianity. But what we can do is show that there's no actual evidence for it. Remember the null hypothesis from earlier? This is when it comes into play. With nothing to actually back up your claim, it's just as valid as any other religion, or any other claim I can make about anything.</p>
        <h3><q>But what about the apostles, didn't they die for Christianity?</q></h3>
            <p>That says nothing about how true it is. There have been people who die for Islam, for Hinduism, and for every other religion. Are their religions validated the same way that yours are?</p>
        <h3><q>Why not just believe? If you're wrong, you lose nothing, but if you're right you gain so much?</q></h3>
            <p>That's already been thought of. Otherwise known as Pascal's wager, this theory rings true only if you take only two positions, Christianity and Atheism. If you think of Hinduism, or Islam, or any other religion, suddenly your odds drop dramatically. And if you take into account any other imaginary gods, like, for instance, the Anti-Christian god, who punishes you if you do things that make the Christian god happy, and vice versa, you end up with a net gain of 0. Thus, it doesn't matter what you believe in, mathematically there's no afterlife.</p>
        <h3><q>But what created the universe? Every effect has a cause, right?</q></h3>
            <p>Says who? Science so far thinks the universe has always existed, in some form or another. Also, why is your god exempt? What caused it?</p>
        <h3><q>You just gotta have faith.</q></h3>
            <p>Is there any position you couldn't take on faith? What about the position that your god doesn't exist? I take it on faith that there is no god. Isn't that just as valid? If two people can get to different conclusions based purely on faith, what's the point of faith? </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>There's not much in Christianity that makes it seem valid. With as many contradictions, absurdities, and plot holes as it has, it's no wonder why people call it Holy. But that's okay right? We can still believe without evidence. That's why we all still believe in Santa, right?</p>
